# Hungry Eagle

Welcome to the repository of **Hungry Eagle**, a web application made especially for Emory Students. This app is designed to make your gastronomical journeys on campus a fun, and delightful experience.

The Hungry Eagle app is a food place recommendation system, randomly generating suggestions for where you should eat next. It provides useful information such as cuisine type, address, Yelp rating, and more.

This project is currently under development. A working prototype is available at the following link: [Prototype Link](https://spiffy-kelpie-8fe194.netlify.app/)
